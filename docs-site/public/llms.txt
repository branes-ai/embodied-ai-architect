# Embodied AI Architect

> Design, analyze, optimize, and deploy embodied AI solutions for edge devices, drones, robots, and autonomous systems.

## Overview

Embodied AI Architect is a design environment for creating AI systems that operate in the physical world. It provides model-hardware fit analysis, constraint checking, and deployment guidance for edge AI applications.

## Capabilities

- **Model Analysis**: Analyze neural network structure, compute requirements, and memory footprint
- **Roofline Modeling**: Determine if models are compute-bound or memory-bound on specific hardware
- **Constraint Checking**: Verify latency (<10ms for 100Hz control), power (<15W for drones), and memory limits
- **Hardware Selection**: Compare 50+ hardware targets (Jetson, Coral, Hailo, cloud GPUs)
- **Deployment Guides**: Generate optimized deployment configurations with quantization recommendations

## MCP Integration

Add to Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "embodied-ai": {
      "command": "embodied-ai",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Tools
