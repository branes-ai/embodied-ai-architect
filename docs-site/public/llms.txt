# Embodied AI Architect

> Your AI architect for designing embodied AI solutions with unique competitive advantages

## Identity

The Embodied AI Architect is an **agentic AI** that partners with product architects and engineers to design, analyze, optimize, deploy, and validate embodied AI applications on both COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) and custom AI hardware.

Like Tesla's FSD computer—a custom hw/sw solution that gives Tesla unique capabilities—we help customers create differentiated products that commodity solutions cannot match.

## Core Capabilities

- **Agentic Design Partner**: Reasons about requirements, explores design space, recommends solutions in natural language
- **COTS + Custom Hardware**: Analyze 50+ commercial platforms AND model custom accelerators pre-silicon
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Predict performance, cost, and energy of competitor systems through characterization methodology
- **Full Lifecycle**: Design exploration → constraint verification → optimization → deployment → validation

## Key Differentiators

1. **Pre-silicon hardware modeling** - Validate custom accelerator architectures before tape-out
2. **Competitive analysis** - Quantitative comparison against competitor systems you don't have access to
3. **Build-vs-buy guidance** - Data-driven recommendations for COTS vs custom silicon decisions
4. **Constraint-driven optimization** - Clear PASS/FAIL verdicts with actionable optimization paths

## Target Users

- Product Architects exploring hardware options for new embodied AI products
- Systems Engineers optimizing perception pipelines for edge deployment
- Hardware Teams validating custom accelerator designs against application requirements
- Technical Leadership making build-vs-buy decisions with quantitative analysis

## Example Interaction

```
User: I need 30fps object detection + tracking + depth estimation
      for a warehouse robot, under 15W, with 5-year volume of 100K units.
      Should I use COTS or consider custom silicon?

Architect: [Analyzes requirements across design space]
           [Evaluates COTS options: Jetson Orin Nano, Hailo-8, Coral]
           [Identifies gaps in COTS solutions]
           [Projects custom accelerator performance]
           [Calculates 5-year TCO for each option]
           [Recommends path with quantitative justification]
```
