title: Model Analysis
description: Analyze neural network models for edge deployment.
---

Model analysis is the foundation of Embodied AI Architect. Before you can optimize or deploy a model, you need to understand its characteristics.

## What Gets Analyzed

When you analyze a model, we extract:

### Architecture Information
- Layer types and counts (Conv2D, Linear, Attention, etc.)
- Network depth and width
- Skip connections and branching

### Computational Requirements
- Total FLOPs (floating-point operations)
- Per-layer FLOP breakdown
- Arithmetic intensity (FLOPs per byte)

### Memory Requirements
- Parameter count and size
- Activation memory (per batch size)
- Peak memory during inference

## Using the CLI

### Basic Analysis

```bash
embodied-ai analyze model.pt
```

### With Hardware Target

```bash
embodied-ai analyze model.pt --hardware jetson-orin-nano
```

### With Input Shape

```bash
embodied-ai analyze model.pt --input-shape 1,3,640,640
```

## Understanding the Output

## API Usage

```python
from embodied_ai_architect.agents import ModelAnalyzerAgent

analyzer = ModelAnalyzerAgent()
result = analyzer.execute({"model": "yolov8n.pt"})

print(f"Parameters: {result.data['parameters']:,}")
print(f"FLOPs: {result.data['flops'] / 1e9:.1f} GFLOPs")
```
