## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip or uv package manager

## Basic Installation

Install the core package:

```bash
pip install embodied-ai-architect
```

Or with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for faster installation:

```bash
uv pip install embodied-ai-architect
```

## Installation Options

### Development Mode

For development with all tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/branes-ai/embodied-ai-architect.git
cd embodied-ai-architect
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### With Remote Backends

For SSH and Kubernetes benchmark backends:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,remote,kubernetes]"
```

### With Interactive Chat

For the Claude-powered interactive assistant:

```bash
pip install -e ".[chat]"
```

This requires an Anthropic API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Related Packages

For full functionality, install the companion packages:

### embodied-schemas

Shared data models and hardware catalog:

```bash
pip install embodied-schemas
# Or from source:
pip install -e ../embodied-schemas
```

### graphs

Roofline analysis and hardware simulation:

```bash
pip install graphs
# Or from source:
pip install -e ../graphs
```

## Verify Installation
