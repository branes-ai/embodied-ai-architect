## Design Embodied AI Solutions That Competitors Can't Match

The **Embodied AI Architect** is an agentic AI that gives product architects and engineers superpowers to design, create, analyze, test, optimize, validate, and deploy embodied AI applications. The key difference of Embodied AI applications over their Datacenter relatives is that latency and energy targets are functional requirements:

- Can't identify an object in 5msec, your autonomous vehicle will fail. 
- Can't execute your MPC optimization using less than 2.5W, your drone mission will fail. 
- Can't deliver reliable 30 frames per second throughput, your situational awareness will fail.

As Product Architect, you need to identify performance and energy-efficiency requirements early and accurately so you can create differentiated products that define new categories. The Branes Embodied AI Architect platform delivers deep insights into your Embodied AI application as early as your requirements analysis phase.

## Why Custom Matters

Commodity AI hardware serves commodity use cases. But breakthrough products—autonomous vehicles, surgical robots, industrial drones—require **purpose-built solutions** that optimize the entire stack:

| Approach | Capabilities | Examples |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Commodity** | General-purpose, cost-optimized | Jetson Nano, Coral TPU |
| **Custom** | Application-specific, performance-optimized | Tesla FSD, Apple Neural Engine |

The Embodied AI Architect helps you determine when custom hardware delivers competitive advantage and guides the design process from requirements through silicon.

## What the Architect Does

### Intelligent Design Exploration

```bash
embodied-ai chat
> I need 30fps object detection + tracking + depth estimation
> for a warehouse robot, under 15W, with 5-year production volume of 100K units.
> Should I use COTS or consider custom silicon?
```

The Architect analyzes your requirements across the design space—evaluating COTS options, identifying gaps, and recommending whether custom hardware justifies the investment.

### Predictive Competitive Analysis

Understand how your solution compares before you build:

```bash
embodied-ai analyze my-pipeline.yaml \
  --compare jetson-orin-agx,hailo-8,competitor-estimate \
  --metrics latency,power,unit-cost,5yr-tco
```

Our characterization methodology predicts competitor performance, enabling informed build-vs-buy decisions and competitive positioning.

### Constraint-Driven Optimization

Get clear verdicts on whether designs meet requirements:

```
> Can my perception pipeline hit 100Hz for real-time control on a 10W budget?

FAIL - Current design achieves 45Hz at 10W.

Optimization paths:
1. Reduce model: YOLOv8n → MobileNet (achieves 95Hz, -8% accuracy)
2. Custom accelerator: KPU-T64 projection (achieves 120Hz at 8W)
3. Algorithm change: Replace dense depth with sparse features (achieves 110Hz)

Recommendation: Option 3 maintains accuracy while meeting constraints.
```
