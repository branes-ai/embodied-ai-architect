# Quick Start

## Baseline Performance Targets

  I defined expected performance metrics in the catalog:

  baseline_targets:
    detection_recall:
      cars: 0.85
      person: 0.80
      bicycle: 0.75

    tracking_metrics:
      id_switches_per_100_frames: 2.0
      track_persistence_avg: 25

    performance:
      fps_cpu_yolov8n: 20
      fps_gpu_yolov8n: 60

## Get Started Now

```bash
  cd prototypes/drone_perception

  # Install dependencies (adds pyyaml)
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  # Download quick test suite (~50MB)
  python scripts/download_test_videos.py --suite quick

  # Run first test!
  python scripts/run_test_suite.py --suite quick
```

## Testing the Design Assistant

### Prerequisites

  1. Install with chat dependencies:
  pip install -e ".[chat]"
  2. Set your Anthropic API key:
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

### Running It

```bash
  embodied-ai chat
```

  Or with verbose mode to see tool execution details:
```bash
  embodied-ai chat -v
```

### What's Working

  - Interactive Claude-powered chat with tool use
  - 5 base tools: analyze_model, recommend_hardware, run_benchmark, list_files, read_file
  - 5 advanced tools (if branes-ai/graphs is installed): analyze_model_detailed, compare_hardware_targets, identify_bottleneck, list_available_hardware,
  estimate_power_consumption
  - Rich console UI with tool execution visibility
  - Session commands: exit, reset, help

### What's Missing (for production)

  - No test suite yet (tests/ is empty)
  - No streaming responses (waits for complete response)
  - No session persistence
  - No constraint natural language parsing (e.g., "under 10W")

### Quick Test Commands

  Once in the chat, try:
  > What models can you analyze?
  > List the files in the prototypes directory
  > What hardware targets are available?

  If you have a PyTorch model file:
  > Analyze the model at path/to/model.pt
