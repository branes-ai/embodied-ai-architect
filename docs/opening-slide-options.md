# Opening Slide Options — Embodied AI Architect

Five different first slides for introducing the pain point: general-purpose silicon is too inefficient for autonomy and does not provide sovereign compute supply.

## Slide 1 — The Stark Number

**Title:** "1,000x"

**Subtitle:** The efficiency gap between general-purpose silicon and what autonomy actually demands.

**Body:**
- GPUs and CPUs waste 90–99% of their power on logic your autonomous system never uses
- Every watt wasted is range lost, latency added, and margin surrendered
- You can't ship autonomy on hardware designed for spreadsheets

**Closing line:** *General-purpose silicon was never built for this job.*

## Slide 2 — The Dependency Trap

**Title:** "Your Autonomy Runs on Someone Else's Roadmap"

**Subtitle:** When your compute comes from a general-purpose supply chain, you don't control your own future.

**Body:**
- NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Intel optimize for their highest-volume markets — not yours
- Allocation shortages, export controls, and product pivots can strand your program overnight
- Autonomy without sovereign compute is autonomy on borrowed time

**Closing line:** *If you don't own the silicon strategy, you don't own the autonomy.*

## Slide 3 — The Physics Wall

**Title:** "Autonomy Has a Power Budget. General-Purpose Silicon Blows Through It."

**Subtitle:** Edge autonomy lives inside a hard envelope: watts, grams, cubic centimeters. GP silicon doesn't fit.

**Body:**
- A drone has 5–15W for compute. A GP SoC burns that on the memory controller alone.
- An autonomous vehicle needs μs-latency perception. GP cache hierarchies add ms.
- The laws of physics don't negotiate. Your silicon has to meet the system where it lives.

**Closing line:** *You can't solve an efficiency problem with more transistors.*

## Slide 4 — The False Economy

**Title:** "Cheap Chips, Expensive Systems"

**Subtitle:** General-purpose silicon looks affordable — until you count everything it forces you to add around it.

**Body:**
- Bigger batteries to feed inefficient compute
- Active cooling to manage waste heat
- Software layers to work around hardware that wasn't designed for your workload
- Redundant hardware because single-chip reliability isn't guaranteed for your use case

**Closing line:** *The BOM cost of the chip is a fraction of the system cost it inflicts.*

---

## Slide 5 — The Strategic Question

**Title:** "Who Controls the Compute That Controls the Machine?"

**Subtitle:** Autonomy is a strategic capability. Strategic capabilities require sovereign supply chains.

**Body:**
- Nations are restricting chip exports. General-purpose silicon is a geopolitical instrument.
- Every autonomous system you ship creates a long-term dependency on whoever fabs the compute.
- Your competitors who solve this first don't just win on performance — they win on availability.

**Closing line:** *Sovereignty isn't optional. It's the prerequisite.*

## Recommendation

- **Slides 2 and 5** hit hardest for executive/defense audiences where supply chain risk is existential.
- **Slides 1 and 3** resonate more with engineering leaders who feel the inefficiency daily.
- **Slide 4** works well for CFOs and procurement teams focused on total system cost.
