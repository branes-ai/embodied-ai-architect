# The Dependency Trap — 5-Slide Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1

**YOUR AUTONOMY RUNS ON SOMEONE ELSE'S ROADMAP**

- Their highest-volume market isn't yours
- Allocation shortages strand programs overnight
- Export controls redraw the map without warning

---

## Slide 2

**THE GAP IS GETTING WORSE**

| | The constraint | The trend |
|---|---|---|
| **Physics** | 5W drone, 30W robot | Workloads growing, scaling slowing |
| **Geopolitics** | 2 countries fab advanced silicon | Export controls expanding |
| **Economics** | $50 chip → $500 system penalty | Competitors won't overpay forever |

---

## Slide 3

**DESCRIBE THE MISSION. GET THE SILICON.**

```
"Delivery drone, visual SLAM + detection,
 30fps, under 5 watts"

        ↓  Embodied AI Architect

 Validated SoC design with RTL
```

- Workload analysis → architecture exploration → constraint validation → Verilog
- One engineer. One afternoon.

## Slide 4

**IT WORKS TODAY**

| Demo | Result | Runtime |
|------|--------|---------|
| Drone SoC | Auto-optimized to all-PASS constraints | 1.5 sec |
| Quadruped SoC | 4 concurrent workloads, Pareto ranked | < 2 sec |
| RTL pipeline | Synthesizable Verilog, verified with Yosys | seconds |

50+ COTS platforms profiled. Custom accelerator RTL generation. No cloud dependency.

## Slide 5

**OWN THE COMPUTE. OWN THE AUTONOMY.**

| Evaluate | Design | Verify |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 2 weeks | 8 weeks | 12 weeks |
| Your workloads on COTS + custom | Validated SoC architecture | Tape-out ready |

**Next step:** 2-week evaluation sprint. You bring models. We bring the platform.
