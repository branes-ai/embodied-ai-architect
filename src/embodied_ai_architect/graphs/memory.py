"""Working memory for specialist agents in the SoC design loop.

Tracks what each agent has tried, decided, and discovered across iterations.
This prevents the optimizer from re-trying failed strategies and enables
agents to learn from previous attempts within a design session.

Working memory is serialized into SoCDesignState["working_memory"] via
model_dump() and reconstructed via WorkingMemoryStore(**data).

Usage:
    from embodied_ai_architect.graphs.memory import WorkingMemoryStore

    store = WorkingMemoryStore()
    store.record_attempt(
        agent_name="design_optimizer",
        description="INT8 quantization",
        outcome="Power reduced from 6.3W to 5.1W — still FAIL",
        iteration=1,
    )

    mem = store.get_agent_memory("design_optimizer")
    already_tried = [t["description"] for t in mem.things_tried]
