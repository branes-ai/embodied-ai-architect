"""LangGraph-based operator orchestration for embodied AI pipelines.

This module provides LangGraph-based orchestration for embodied AI operators.
Requires the 'langgraph' optional dependency:

    pip install -e ".[langgraph]"

Usage:
    from embodied_ai_architect.graphs import (
        build_perception_graph,
        build_autonomy_graph,
        PipelineRunner,
    )

    graph = build_perception_graph()
    runner = PipelineRunner(graph)
    result = runner.run_batch(frame=image)
