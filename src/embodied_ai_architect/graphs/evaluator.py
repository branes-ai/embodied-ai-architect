"""AgenticEvaluator — 9-dimension evaluation framework for SoC design sessions.

Runs all 9 scoring functions against a RunTrace, computes weighted composite
scores, and produces Scorecards.

    evaluator = AgenticEvaluator(gold_standards=ALL_GOLD_STANDARDS)
    scorecard = evaluator.evaluate_run(trace)
